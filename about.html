        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Jaden! This is a little bit about me. I love technology, being outside, and spending time with my friends.
            I am a Geomatics Engineering undergrad student, with a minor in Software Engineering. I think this class is going to be very
            interesting and reinforce much of what I have learned in previous courses and while working as a software dev.
            My work has always been more related to backend code so learning front end is quite interesting. 
        </p>

                document.body.classList.toggle("colour-mode");
